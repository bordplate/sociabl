# What is this?
This is a generic social network running on top of the Vapor Framework for Swift and MySQL. It's goal is to be some sort of microblogging where people can follow each other. 

# Why? 
I'm going to use it in a future workshop for teaching iOS development. And it's fun to just make stuff.
